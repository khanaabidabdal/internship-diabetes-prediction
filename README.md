# Internship-diabetes-prediction

The following project is an internship task assign by Meriskill to train a model to predict the diabetes of the women as this dataset contains only a data of women. The steps invloved in this project are as follows :

1)Reading CSV Files
2)Checking Null values and Filling Them.(Data Cleaning)
3)visualizations : To know the relationship between independent and dependent variable.
4)Splitting the data and scalling it
5)Identifying input columns and target columns.
6)Logistic regrassion
7)Random Forest
8)Gradien Boosting
9)Comparing different Model and Selecting Best One.
10)Using Best Model on Custom data
11)Conclusion

The following are the conclusion :

1)Dataset is small that's why model is overfitting in first attempt.
2)The Dataset can include data like diet, difficulty in walking,education about diabetes,etc.
3)Our Moadel is giving 81% accuracy that is good in such problems beacuse the bilogical law are not perfect.
4)With increase in dataset our model can reach accurcy of 90%.
